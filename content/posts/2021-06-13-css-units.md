# CSS values and units

CSS isn't magic but sometimes it can be confusing when things don't work out. I am not a CSS expert, I am not even a CSS intermediate. It's just that sometimes I need a reference of what the value means.

## What is a CSS Unit?
A CSS unit determines the size of a property of the element of your css selector. For example, if you want to set a paragraph's font size, you can give a value which will have a css unit.

```css
  p {
    font-size: 20px;
  }
```

## Units
There are 2 types of units: absolute and relative. When you are styling your website, it is important to know which type to use.

### Absolute units
The only absolute unit you should use is `px`. It stands for `pixels`.  Its equivalent length is `1px = 1/96th of 1in`. Other absolute units are only useful for print layout (ie. `in`, `cm`, `mm`) which is not common.

### Relative units
| Unit | Relative to                                               |
|------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| %    | Relative to the parent element‚Äôs value for that property. |
| em   | font size of the parent (or current) element.             |
| rem  | Font size of the root element.                            |
| vw   | 1% of the viewport's width.                               |
| vh   | 1% of the viewport's height.                              |
| vmin | 1% of the viewport's smaller dimension.                   |
| vmax | 1% of the viewport's larger dimension.                    |

## Rule of thumb üëç
* Use `rem` for font-size: Do **NOT** px for font sizes.
* Use `rem` or `em` for paddings and margins
* Use `%` for widths
* Use `px` for borders and pseudo elements (cosmetic)

Think about these questions if you are in a pickle.

* Does the element need to scale when the viewport size change?
* If so, which relative unit do you want to use?
