Today I stumbled upon a new term that I never heard of in best practice for password hashing, `pepper` ðŸ«‘. I've heard of salting that is adding a uniquely generate random value to password before its hash function. `Salt` is to prevent rainbow table attacks by adding enough space to the table size so it's impossible to look up. 

However, I've never heard or seen the term `pepper` being used in password hashing. I was very intrigued. It is not defined in the [RFC-4949](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc4949) where `salt` is defined.


## Pepper (cryptography)


The concept is similar to `salt`. It is a secret value added to the password before hash. Unlike `salt`, `peppers` must not be stored along side with the password hash, and the same pepper value can be used for different passwords. `Peppers` are usually stored in the application configuration securely, or in a secure vault that is not in the database. 

### Why is it useful?

Imagine each password is hashed as `hash(password + salt + pepper)`. Now, if the database is leaked, attackers get the `hashed` output and `salt` and can try brute-forcing them. But if there's an unknown pepper involved, they cannot directly brute force them. With the pepper, the attackers have to factor in `pepper`, making brute-forcing impossible unless they also have access to the applicationâ€™s configuration.

It is an extra layer of defense, making it harder for anyone to crack the password.


There are also other considerations when employing `pepper` strategy:
* Additional storage complexity and ensure each service can connect to it securely.
* `pepper` rotation strategy should be considered. Any changes to the `pepper` value would invalidate all password hashes, multiple `pepper` should be considered.
* Each time a password change, `pepper` value should be the latest value per the policy.


Overall, this was a fun thing to learn about. `pepper` adds another layer of security, it also introduces **operational complexity** and is only effective when properly secured and isolated from the database.
