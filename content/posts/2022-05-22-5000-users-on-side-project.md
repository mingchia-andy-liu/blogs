## My Side Project üèÄ

My NBA browser extension side project passed 5000+ active users this week. It achieved this milestone on Chrome! I am just really excited and speechless. 

I started this project back in 2016 when I was in university. I had been watching NBA for a while and never had a good source of box scores updates. And I thought why not make it myself. 


I started this browser extension with the goal of finding the scores easier for myself. I can still remember coding in a coffee shop at the start with friends. I've gotten so much feedback and requests from users around the world. It amazes me that my little project can be used by so many people. Even though I've never met any of user, I want to say thank you to everyone.
