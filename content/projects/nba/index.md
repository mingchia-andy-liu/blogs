This is a browser extension to view box scores for NBA games. You can see live scores, standings, play-by-play updates, and highlights with just one click.

I started this project back in 2016 when I was in university. I had been watching the NBA for a while and never had a reliable source for box score updates. The official NBA website was clunky, and ESPN covered too many other sports. I simply wanted a clean interface to show me which teams were playing and the scores. Eventually, I thought, why not create it myself?

The project eventually evolved to include many more features than I had originally imagined. Now, it provides box scores for each game, standings, playoff standings, and the ability to view games from different dates. I even added a feature that provides highlight videos from the NBA's official YouTube channel for each game.
