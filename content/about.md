Hello! I am Andy, born in Taiwan ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¼ and currently living in North America. Interested in web dev, cryptography (not the hard core math), 80s rock music.

This blog mainly contains things I've learned or built, and some write-ups for CTFs. I write random blogs as well.

### Some random facts about me

My absolute favorite band is [<mark>Girls' Generation</mark>](https://www.youtube.com/@GIRLSGENERATION), I even [built a little something for me about them]({{< ref "/projects/instagram" >}})

I love the show [<mark>Friends</mark>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w3wmQAMoxQ), I've watched it over 10 times from beginning to the end. I can quote almost every scene.
